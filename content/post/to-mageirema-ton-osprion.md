**Germination**

*Soaked whole grams can be sprouted prior to cooking to increase vitamin levels, reduce the molecular weight of the carbohydrates that are present, and increase the availability of essential amino acids and relative nutritional value of the food (Wang and Fields, 1979). The amylases, released during germination hydrolyze starch to shorter-chain carbohydrates and sugars, facilitating digestibility and reducing viscosity at elevated concentrations to increase the caloric density of foods (Mosha and Svanberg, 1983). Once sprouted, grains have to be dried if they are to remain stable. Heating during or following drying increases flavor and acceptability.*
